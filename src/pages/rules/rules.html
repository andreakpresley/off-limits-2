  <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
  <p>
    The point of the game is to get your game to guess the word at the top of the card without saying any of the disallowed words underneath.
  </p>
  <h2>SETTING UP</h2>
  <p>
    If you want, you can change the winning score, timer length, team names, and difficulty level on the Settings page.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Break your group up into 2 teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. One person from Team 1 will start with the phone in hand. They will be the one giving hints.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. The rest of Team 1 needs to be somewhere that they can't see the phone's screen. They are the guessers.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. One person from Team 2 needs to be able to see the phone to make sure the hinter from Team 1 doesn't say any of the disallowed words.
  </p>
  <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
  <p>
    1. The first team will start the game by choosing "Start New Game."
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Once "OK" is pressed on the Ready screen, the card will show and the timer will start ticking down.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. While the timer is going, the hinter on Team 1 will try to get their team to guess the word at the top of the card. If they say any of the disallowed words, the watcher must yell "Can't Say That!" and the hinter must press the red button.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. If a disallowed word is said, you must skip that card and lose a point.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. At the end of the round, teams switch positions and start again!
  </p>
  <h2>SCORING</h2>
  <p>
    +1 if your team guesses the word correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
    -1 if you skip a card or say a disallowed word.
